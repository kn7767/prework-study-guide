# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to keep coding notes all in one spot in an organized space. It was built not only to keep what I've learned about coding in one spot, but also to put this knowledge into practice and build a foundation of knowledge about the functions of Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
